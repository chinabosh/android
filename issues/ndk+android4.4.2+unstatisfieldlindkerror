I am using a native library that includes opencv. The library builds well and works well in all devices and emulators, but not on Android 4.2 ones. It crashes on System.loadLibrary("mylib");.

The library is built for armeabi-v7a armeabi x86 mips (I see in the jnilibs folder that all the so files were generated)

I am stuck on this bug because I couldn't find any answer on the internet which could explain my problem.

Cannot load library: soinfo_link_image(linker.cpp:1635): could not load library "libopencv_java.so", log trace:

I found my answer. It's two steps:

1/ If you're using an emulator Genymotion, with an Android 4.2.2, you will have a missing library, caused by one of the updates of Genimotion. See this. Solution : (1)> download the following zip file: here. (2)> simply drag and drop it to your emulator. (3)> restart your emulator.

2/ In the Android 4.2 the OS has problems to find paths to jni libraries shipped in the apk. For example in my case, I am using a jni library that uses the openCV library. For every device and android version calling System.loadLibrary("mylib"); worked well and mylib loaded automatically the opencv library. For the Android 4.2, as @Chris said in his comment, I loaded openCV explicitly, so :

System.loadLibrary("opencv_java");
System.loadLibrary("mylib");
